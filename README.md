# Automated-Report-Generation---Student-Game-Data

Who is the Audience?
•	 (Director of Research)
•	The president & internal leadership
•	Donors

Our original goal was to address these questions in order to support the argument that our games help students develop 21st century skills according to the P21 framework.  Started with these questions

⁃	Question: How do we use game data to assess student development of 21st century skills through the decision-making that they make in the game?
⁃	Question: How is the data related to student performing on the survey measure of 21st century skills?

Before I was brought on the director of research was basically a one-person shop where she handled strategy, design, implementation, analysis, and insight.  This organization has been around for over 25 years and serves over 250,000 students around the country.

Challenge: The data we had was not collected properly due to poor data governance:
⁃	The unique IDs didn’t match
⁃	We lost majority of our sample so we needed to pivot

I ran power analysis to confirm that we didn’t have the sample size needed to address these questions the way we intended  

We pivoted.

Our new goal:
⁃	Educate
⁃	Helps marking Easier to demonstrate the value when you understand how R&D impacts design/developers
⁃	Codifying our insights in a way that allows us to repurpose them for multiple audiences
⁃	Interpretability- When developers are on the same page as as R&D 
⁃	Create marketing content:
⁃	Demonstrate the value of the increased investment in the VS game as an instrument vs the other two less sophisticated game
⁃	Inform donors & employees on our trajectory
⁃	Generate automated reports 
⁃	so that data novices can understand  and stake holders can 1-click 
⁃	Take work off of Hee Jin’s plate so she can focus
⁃	Give us a baseline so that in the near future we can execute quasi-experimentation & strengthen our argument that we’re developing 21st century skills

Outcome:
⁃	One-Pager 
⁃	Code that connects to theSQL servers and generates reports using histograms and box plots
⁃	Trouble shooting doc
